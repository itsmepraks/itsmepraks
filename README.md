# Prakriti Bista
 
**ML/AI Engineer + UX Designer** building intelligent systems at the intersection of machine learning and human-centered design.
 
Currently building projects focused on building projects on gamification, interactions, and architecting efficient LLM-powered systems.

### What I'm Building
```typescript
const currentFocus = {
  projects: ["DC Interactive Map", "SEAS Search (KG-QA System)"],
  using: ["TypeScript", "Python", "Efficient LLM Architecture"],
  exploring: ["Knowledge Graphs + Multi-hop Reasoning + AI Agents"],
  location: ["Washington, DC, USA"]
};
```
